# Code Challenges

## Accepting a challenge!

When you want to upload your solution, clone the repo if you haven't already and do the following:

- Navigate to the challenge folder and go into the `solutions/` folder inside.
- Create a folder with your name (I would make a folder `chrisevans`.
- Put your solution files inside, following the rules specified by the person who created the challenge.
- Create a Pull Request with your changes and share in the Slack Channel.

## Creating a challenge

PR your challenges as a new directory within here, name the directory as so:

`yyyymmdd-name-challenge-name` i.e. `20190327-chrisevans-fibonacci-seq`

Pop a README.md file in there with instructions and add any necessary files /
structure alongside it. Leave a directory named `solutions` which people can add
pull requests with their solutions to.

Example:

- 20190327-chrisevans-fibonacci-seq/
  
  - / README.md

  - / src /

  - / solutions /
