# Code Challenges

PR your challenges as a new directory within here, name the directory as so:

`yyyymmdd-name-challenge-name` i.e. `20190327-chrisevans-fibonacci-seq`

Pop a README.md file in there with instructions and add any necessary files /
structure alongside it. Leave a directory named `solutions` which people can add
pull requests with their solutions to.

Example:

- 20190327-chrisevans-fibonacci-seq/
  
  - / README.md

  - / src /

  - / solutions /
