# Code Challenges

PR your challenges as a new directory within here, name the directory as so:

`yyyymmdd-name-challenge-name` i.e. `20190327-chrisevans-fibonacciSeq`

Pop a README.md file in there with instructions and add any necessary files /
structure alongside it. Leave a directory named `solutions` which people can add
pull requests with their solutions to.
